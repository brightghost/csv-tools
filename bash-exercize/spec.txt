These are the Wellspring coding exercises.

These exercises have a ramping difficulty level, with the last task
indexed to the ability of a mid-level engineer at Wellspring.  You are
not expected to be able to complete the full set (but we appreciate any
attempt to do so!).  Please don't spend more than 4 to 6 hours on this!
 You have 1 week to submit your results, but we'd prefer to see them
back by Monday if possible.

There are 3 CSV files included with this exercise.  They will be used as
input to your scripts.

Each task should be implemented as a separate script.  Your scripts will
be run like this:

/bin/bash 1.sh 1.csv 2.csv 3.csv
/bin/bash 2.sh 1.csv 2.csv 3.csv
/bin/bash 3.sh 1.csv 2.csv 3.csv
/bin/bash 4.sh 1.csv 2.csv 3.csv
...etc...

For all exercises, don't worry about printing extra copies of the header.


Please perform the following tasks:

1) Merge the input data into one file named "merged.csv".

2) Print out all lines that contain the string "NODATA" on stderr

3) Sort all input data by 'timestamp' and output on stdout with more
recent timestamps at the bottom.

4) Sort all input data by 'name' and output on stdout with Z at the top
and A at the bottom.

5) Print the number of times each name appears on stdout.  Sort the list
by number of appearances with largest numbers at the bottom.

6) Print the average of all values in the 'result1' column to stdout.

7) Print the mean, media and mode for the combined values from the
result1, result2 and result3 columns, broken out by the 'name' column.
